# Human Readable addresses for FTM

what is human-readable address ?<br>
Human readable addresses - or HRAs - replace the long, complex strings of characters used by most blockchains to identify individuals and their receiving addresses. Human readable addresses make it easy to share wallet addresses and your crypto-identity in everyday conversation. HRAs use a simple @name designation, and therefore are easy to remember in everyday conversation.
Near & Ton Coin using a system like that. (user1.Near, user1.Ton)

Let's me to summarize HRAs idea into 2 minutes.
As u know, human-readable address is an FTM address shortener, and it's a domain too.
Why we shouldn't use a conventional domain wich is supported by all the browsers ATM?
At the first time bit.ly did that with long urls and they were successful.
Now we have a wallet address need to be short.
So we will give a domain like user1.FTMP.com to every users who want it instead of user1.FTM (Both domains will have same functionality)

In this way we are publishing the main website url through the all social medias does users using and it's making back links to our main website.( Why bit.ly is famous?)
This is all the idea.
We made a chrome extension for that but because of low time didn't complete yet (Check /extenstion directory) âœ…

The chrome extension is supporting our human-readable address.
It's working like Metamask but with an especial feature.
This wallet will inject a javascript code to the webpage and will highlight all the human-readable address. and make donation process easier.

when a users use our HRAs in their social media will make a backlink to our website.<br>
this feature will affect on the main website SEO
(in this case ftmp.com) and will increase the ranking of the website.<br>
every users who using HRAs is our advertiser throughout WorldWideWeb.

Human-readable addresses consist of two parts:
<br>1. Domain Name:<br>
a conventional domain name which is linked to an ip address.
<br>2. Subdomains :<br>
we will give this subdomain to every user who interested in. this subdomain is unique and attached to a FTM wallet address.
<br><br>Example: user1.ftmp.com <br>
Lets to see examples: <br>
old version vs new version <br>
test.ftm ==> test.ftmp.com <br>
fantom.ftm ==> fantom.ftmp.com <br>
swap.ftm ==> swap.ftmp.com <br>
z.ftm ==> z.ftmp.com <br>
